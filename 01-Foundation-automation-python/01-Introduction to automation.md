## Introduction to programming
Computer programs are a set of instructions that tell what and when the computer should perform a particular task. The instructions are written in specialized languages that the computer can understand easily called programming languages.

Programming is the process of writing the set of instructions for the computer using a programming language. There are many programming languages each has it features, drawbacks and applications in computer programming.

We will us Python as our main programming language and we will write multiple scripts and programs in Python. Scripts are short set of instructions that only do a single or small tasks while a program is a set of multiple scripts that helps us to do more complex tasks.

## What is automation?
The process of making small tasks that take too much time into a simple press of a button using technology is called automation. Any task that you perform on your computer that takes a lot of time can be automated using Python to be completed using a single click of a mouse or you can even schedule it to be performed automatically during a certain time.

Automation is a great thing and it makes our lives easier but having the ability to create your own automation scripts and programs is more impressive.
Introduction to Python

There are many programming languages to choose from and each one of them is suited for different tasks, JavaScript is for web development and C++ is for embedded and low level programming etc.

Python is an easy to learn and human friendly programming language and is a very popular programming language and is used in many different fields like machine learning, artificial intelligence, and even web development.

Guido van Rossum is the creator of Python and he created Python in 1991 and since then the adoption of Python has increased rapidly and is super popular in the IT sector because it's available to use on almost all operating systems and has use cases in almost all sectors of IT.
